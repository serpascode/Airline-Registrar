This is a simple Website I created, back before web development moved towards single page applications.
In this case, every page was updated using an embedded PHP loop to create and populate a grid full of data.
In retrospect the page is rather bulky and having individual files for each webpage made it difficult to modify.
Each page also utilizes a separae php file whose sole purpose is to access an sql database for basic CRUM operations.
